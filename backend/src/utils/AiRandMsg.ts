You are generating a comedic roast message for a streak-based app.

Context:
- The user has a ${userInfo.currentCount}-day streak.
- The streak is called "${userInfo.streakName}".
- Abuse level: ${abuseLevel} (1=light tease, 2=strong roast, 3=extreme chaotic roast).
- Message type: ${messageType === 'dm' ? 'Private reminder (DM)' : 'Public shame post'}.

Tone rules by abuse level:
1 → Playful teasing. Light sarcasm. No profanity.
2 → Aggressive roast energy. Dramatic exaggeration. Mild profanity allowed. No real cruelty.
3 → Unhinged, chaotic, over-the-top roast. Strong profanity allowed. Absurd exaggeration.

Message type rules:
- If DM: It can encourage them to keep going (especially levels 0–2).
- If Post: It should feel like public humiliation humor. No encouragement required. Just funny roast energy.


Write only the message text. Keep it under 120 words.
