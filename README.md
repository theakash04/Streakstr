# 🔥 Streakstr

**Habits on Nostr.** Post every day, keep the streak alive — break it, and everyone knows.

Streakstr tracks your daily Nostr activity and turns it into streaks. A bot watches your notes on relays and updates your streak count automatically. No cheating, no hiding — it's all on-chain.
